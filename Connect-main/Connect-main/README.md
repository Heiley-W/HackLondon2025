# Connect+ (Webapp)

# **Design Brief: Real-Life Social Interaction App**  

## **Project Overview**  
This app is designed to encourage real-world social interactions by replacing the passive nature of traditional social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter. Instead of consuming content online, users will engage with people around them based on shared interests, recent activities, and location-based interactions.

## **Core Features & Functionality**  

### **1. Connect** (Smart Proximity Notifications)  
🔹 Users will receive notifications when someone with shared interests is nearby.  
🔹 Matching is based on:  
   - Common interests  
   - Predefined settings (e.g., preferred locations, activity types)  
   - Time-based availability (users can opt for specific hours)  
🔹 **Privacy & Safety Features:**  
   - Opt-in levels: “Discreet mode” (low visibility) vs. “Active mode” (real-time interactions)  
   - Anonymized introductions to allow safe exploration before direct contact  
   - Safety check-ins & emergency contact sharing for meetups

### **2. Socialize** (Real-World Interaction & Engagement)  
🔹 Users can see real-time updates of nearby people’s recent activities & interests.  
🔹 Features to encourage real-life engagement:  
   - **Activity Insights:** Displays mutual activities or interests (e.g., “Both visited the art gallery last week”)  
   - **Icebreakers:** Suggested conversation starters based on shared interests  
   - **Event Integration:** Syncs with local events, promoting meetups in group-friendly spaces  

🔹 **Mini-Collaborative Games:**  
   - Users who meet up can participate in short, engaging challenges designed to foster interaction.  
   - Game types include:  
     ✅ **Puzzle Solving:** A location-based puzzle or riddle that requires teamwork.  
     ✅ **AR Mini-Games:** Augmented Reality-based scavenger hunts or object-finding challenges.  
     ✅ **Trivia & Social Quizzes:** Questions based on shared interests that encourage conversation.  
     ✅ **Time-Based Tasks:** Quick problem-solving exercises that must be completed in person.  
   - Completing challenges unlocks rewards such as badges, social XP, and exclusive in-app perks.  

🔹 Community-driven interaction:  
   - Users can recommend places they’ve been to, forming a dynamic social map.  
   - Community guidelines ensure respectful engagement.

### **3. Feed & Journal** (Personal Activity Log & Matching)  
🔹 Users maintain a journal with interests, activities, and reflections.  
🔹 **Matching Algorithm:**  
   - Clusters users based on similar activity patterns and interests.  
   - Customizable filters let users adjust sensitivity (proximity, recent activities, niche hobbies).  
🔹 **Multi-format Journal Entries:**  
   - Text, photos, and voice notes to capture experiences.  
   - Reflective prompts to encourage real-life engagement.  

🔹 **Interactive Map:**  
   - Displays nearby list of users with shared interests & highlights social hotspots on a map.  
   - Privacy layers (blurred or hidden locations until mutual interaction is agreed upon).
   - Receive notification when a new user is nearby.

## Ideal Process: 
1. Users maintain a regular upload of journal and feed.
2. Server Side AI algorithm learns from user's journal and feed to identify common interests and  activities, then uses LLM to draft ice breaker conversation.
3. When users discover other nearby users on the map, the client side app retrieves common interests and ice breakers between the users, helping them to engage in real life communication.

## Development Progress
### Current Components:
  ✅  Real-time Nearby User Map using Webhook, Node, Express, React
  ✅  Python W2V interest correlation algorithm using python
  ✅  Draft UI of Connect+ Interface
  
### To-be Done:
  - Integrate the seperate components into one solution
  - Improvise JSON structure to communicate in webhook and handle interest correlation scores
  - Implement LLM to draft ice breaker phrases and games based on interest correlation
  - Establish firebase and google oauth to store user account, journals and interest correlation data
  - Polish and improvise AI.

✅ **Local Challenges:** Encourages users to step out of their comfort zones (e.g., “Attend a local event” or “Try a new cafe”).  
✅ **Mini-Collaborative Game Rewards:** Completing games boosts social XP, unlocking exclusive app features and perks.  

### **Integration & User Experience**  
✅ **Event Syncing:** Users can integrate external calendars or popular event apps.  
✅ **Local Business & Community Partnerships:** Encourages real-world experiences through exclusive discounts, collaborations, or special meetups.
